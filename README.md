# Home-Automation--Sensors
Sensors with the Arduino NodeMCU WiFi modules : to detect signals around the house such as gas leaks, floods, and break-ins. These sensors are connected to an android app built on Android Studio, backed by Google Firebase, in order to send notifications to users when sensors pick up signals in the house.
