# Glass Home

A Home Hazardous Prevention System. The app alerts the user and suggests businesses to contact. 

## Description
Glass Home will be a one stop application to keep the home safe and secure. Using various sensors such as a Light Sensor, to sense whether the lights were left on/off; a Temperature Sensor to sense whether the gas stove was left on/off; a Motion Sensor to check if anyone has entered the house; and a Moisture Sensor to check for water leakage; We can monitor areas in the house and send notifications to the users based on signals from the sensors.


## Tools Used
To configure the sensors, we will build sensor schematics on an Arduino/NodeMCU module in order to send signals to a database using Wi-Fi. We will use a firebase database to collect the information from these sensors and reflect that data in an application created on Android Studio
